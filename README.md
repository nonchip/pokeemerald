# my hacks

enabled by default, disable by appending `NONCHIP_HACKS=0` to the `make` command line.

* disabled "Do you want to overwrite an existing save?" dialog
* extended the timer on "You saved the game." to 4 seconds (my flash cartridge takes some additional time to copy the saved data to an SD card)
* enabled the Japanese-only "Mystery Event" and "Mystery Gift over eReader" (with rough english translation) features (they unlock with the normal "Mystery Gift" by putting "LINK TOGETHER WITH ALL" in the PokeMart questionnaire)
* Added a "Shiny Helper" item you get after beating Elite 4
  * this tells you your complete Trainer ID (including the secret part)
  * and it gives you an additional chance at any encountered pokemon being shiny per every 3 times you beat Elite 4 (after the 1st time you get 2 chances per encounter, after the 4th you get 3, ...)
* enabled the RTC reset menu (Select+Left+B on title screen)
